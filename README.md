Using tableau to analyze bikeshare data in nyc

# Overview of our analysis

The purpose of this project is to see if the bike rental business is worth investing in but for a different city(which the customer is requesting). One of the key factors we need to look at is tripduration. Finding out how long the trips are in the month of August will give us a good analysis on when the bikes are rented, how long they are rented and what times are the most popular times to rent a bike. 

# Results:

Using Tableau we discovered the following:

1) Total trips during the month of August were 2,344,224
2) The number of subscribers were 5 times the number of customers
3) The peak time for bike riding is between 6 p.m to 7 p.m
4) The male riders ride the bike for more duration than female riders
5) Thursday is the best day to ride as we see cluster of rides happening for this particular day in the month of August
